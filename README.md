# Discord.JS Typescript Template

## Description

This is a template for the Discord.JS framework, coded in TypeScript. I'm sharing with you the same TypeScript template I created when I first started making my Discord.JS Chatbot(s). My hope is to see more bots pop up, or even better see my code shortened and optimized even further - so if you make something, do share! If you have any questions, DM me.

## Setup

Please refer to [The Wiki](https://github.com/burchamc1100/discordjs-typescript-template/wiki) for setup information.
